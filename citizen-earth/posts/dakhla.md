A lone Toyota rattled down the dark desert road. The driver spoke Arabic and French, I spoke only English, so naturally we rode in silence. I had arrived that day in Dakhla, a peninsula in the Western Sahara and was heading back to my hotel from a camel excursion. 

In the dim headlights something moved. A stray dog crossed the highway. “Heads up”, I said. The driver didn’t slow down. “HEADS UP”, I yelled. The dog had passed out of view on the driver side while I held my breath. Silence. Then came a thud, followed by a scream. The driver muttered something and kept driving as if nothing had happened. I had nightmares that night.

The next morning, still shaken, I went downstairs to make coffee. I sipped my coffee as I took in the stylish Moroccan décor and the stunning views of the sea. Suddenly the sound of a buzzsaw overhead broke the peace. I looked up to see the skeleton of a concrete frame, 9 years into the project. I’d soon learn that all of Dakhla was in a perpetual state of construction, constantly building and rebuilding the city.

I stepped out of the hotel onto rubble. There were no sidewalks, just sand and torn up concrete. Shattered tiles exposed the soft sand beneath. Trash was scattered everywhere. Having booked a three week stay, I was now considering whether I should head out early.

At lunch, I ordered something safe after a recent bout of food poisoning. When the chicken tajine arrived, the waiter lifted the clay lid to expose a plate of chicken organs and meat smothered in french fries. As I picked out the meat, I saw two kids selling homemade sweets on the street. Having just been ignored by a potential customer, they laughed, danced and traded sweets with each other. They then threw their trash on the street and kept walking. What a strange place, I thought to myself.

The next weekend I returned to the desert, this time hauling dirt bikes to the famous white dune. We drove by the husks of half built hotels and the frames of abandoned gas stations. Dakhla had big plans to become Morocco’s next popular tourist destination. French investment poured in until COVID halted everything.

An hour down the road, the driver slowly pulls over to the side of the road. I could smell something burning as he opened the hood. The pipe to the coolant tank had burst causing liquid to pour from the engine compartment onto the sand below. They attempted to reconnect it and add more coolant but the heat caused it to bubble violently back out onto the sand. We sat for the next three hours waiting for help. The driver shrugged, grinned:

“This is the way of Morocco. The French, they have watches. But Moroccans, we have time.”
