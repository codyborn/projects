The wind sprayed water from the crest of the waves into my face. Sunscreen bled into my eyes as I fumbled with the velcro strap, trying to thread it through the binding. The kite, clipped to my waist, yanked me across the surface and tore the board out of my hands. I scanned the horizon for the boat I came on, all while trying very hard not to think about the shark sightings from that morning.

Learning to kiteboard is one of the hardest things I’ve done. Imagine being tied to a moody horse that can fling you across the water with the smallest flick of your wrist, then drag you along just for fun. You’re dodging boats and other riders while simultaneously trying to dance the kite in just the right way to give you constant power. When the wind dies, the kite drops out of the sky and you’re left bobbing in the water with an anchor strapped to your waist until the wind picks up again.

But when it works, it’s magic. Racing across the surface with nothing but the lapping of the wake and the rush of wind feels like stepping into a scene from Avatar. I’ve spotted sea turtles, dodged Portuguese man o’ war, and chased flying fish. When you jump, the world goes silent and you float weightlessly for a few seconds before splashing back down on the water. A century ago, if you told someone that one day we’d have technology to soar through the air and glide across the sea, they’d probably assume everyone would be out there doing it.

That summer I split my time between kiteboarding and working from the French Riviera, mostly in the town of Hyères (pronounced “yer,” with a little French throat-roll on the r). To my surprise, the people were warm and welcoming. Hyères itself is small and refreshingly untouristy, perched on a rare land formation shaped like a whale’s tail. A long sandbar called a tombolo, lined by a narrow highway, connects the “fins” of the tail to the mainland. Its shallow waters form salt marshes that attract thousands of flamingos, and unfortunately, billions of mosquitos. Locals fight back against the mosquitos with clever traps that mimic human breath by emitting carbon dioxide.

Around the same time, my [health tracker](http://guavahealth.com/) turned up an odd correlation. I was happier on days that I ate bread. Curious, I dove into the science and this is what I learned: The brain needs the amino acid tryptophan to make serotonin, our mood-lifting neurotransmitter. The catch is that tryptophan has to compete with other amino acids to cross the blood-brain barrier. Eating carbs triggers insulin, which shuttles most amino acids into muscle, leaving tryptophan with less competition and a better shot at reaching the brain. For the past year I’d been strict about carbs, getting most of mine from vegetables.

So in France, surrounded by world-class bakeries, I ran a little experiment. I introduced wholegrain bread, wore a continuous glucose monitor to keep my blood sugar steady, and added pumpkin seeds (rich in tryptophan). The results? I felt more in the moment, happier, and less stuck in negative loops. Six months later, the effect has been consistent. Maybe it’s a placebo, but it seems to work.

What I've taken away from this experience is that the mind and body aren’t separate. The mind is the body. You can’t just “think harder” to change your mental state; you have to change the environment the mind exists in. Eat well, sleep deeply, keep your cardiovascular system strong, reduce noise and distraction. Do that, and your thoughts and emotions follow suit. I’ll leave you with this comic, which sums it up better than I ever could.
