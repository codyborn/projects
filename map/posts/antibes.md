Little did I know, it was <i>Fête de la Musique</i>—a yearly music festival in France where local musicians and DJs take to the streets in every city to host free concerts. I was nestled in Antibes, a small but charming port town on the Riviera, famous for its sailing regattas and imposing stone fortress.

I was hanging out in my apartment around 4:00 p.m. when the walls began to shake.

<b>DUM DUM DUM BUDUM BUM-BUM-BUM.</b>

The bass from some nearby concert was rattling through my place. I tried to focus on what I was doing, but as the bass intensified, I gave up and went outside to investigate.

Down the street, I found the culprit: a restaurant had set up a full DJ rig, complete with four Funktion One Evo 2L speakers and—this is important—<b>absolutely no audience</b>. Just an empty patio vibrating with enough low-end energy to pâté my insides.

More impressed than angry, I walked inside.

“Hey, sorry to ask,” I shouted, “but any chance you could turn it down a bit? My apartment is twerking against its will.”

“WHAT?”

“THE MUSIC—IT’S KIND OF LOUD.”

He grinned. “It’s Fête de la Musique!”

I blinked. “I don’t know what that means.”

“You’ll see!” he shouted, eyes twinkling. “We go until 1 a.m.”

Slightly dazed, I kept walking and noticed the city was transforming. Every corner, every park, every unassuming alleyway was being converted into a pop-up concert venue. DJs setting up gear. Restaurants prepping drink stations and pre-made meals. Speakers large enough to serve as anti-aircraft turrets.

By sundown, Antibes had become an acoustic buffet. You could stroll from one street to the next, sampling different genres like turning the dial on a radio.
Jazz in one square, reggae in another. House, disco, Latin—take your pick.

I followed the pulsing rhythms and ended up spending the night at a hardcore techno booth, where I learned that Fête de la Musique roughly translates to:
“<b>Tonight, the city belongs to the music.</b>”
